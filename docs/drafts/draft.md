## Observations
For the password input box on the login page, only on a Microsoft Edge browser, a "Show Password" button is automatically added to the side of the login input box.

## Authentication
We will be using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.

We will be using cookies to allow the browser (client) to automatically send the token (that the client receives only after a
successful login) along with every request (regardless of whether it is a "GET" request, "POST" request or another type of request).

Making use of cookies will also allow us to enforce that certain webpages can only be accessed by clients that have logged in
successfully to an account (as cookies are automatically sent with every "GET" request).

There are 3 ways we can send a token with a "GET" request to the server:
- As a URL query parameter.
- As a cookie.
- Using XMLHttpRequest and including the token in its body or as a separate header.

Disadvantages of sending a token as a URL query parameter:
- The token will be visible in the user's browser history (which they might not clear) and in server logs, if the token has not expired
yet, this could allow a threat actor with access to the user's browser history or the server logs to impersonate the actual user.

Disadvantages of sending a token in the body or as a separate header in an XMLHttpRequest:
- This method cannot be used for ensuring that the browser sends the token with each "GET" request made to the server for a resource
(e.g. a HTML, CSS, JS, or image file etc).

Additional notes regarding cookies:
- By default, cookies are cleared once the user closes their browser.
- A cookie can be deleted by setting its expiry date to a past date.
- Cookies can be set on the browser by a response from the server by setting the value of the "Set-Cookie" header (for the response).

## Database schema and data
Employee table:
- StaffID (Text)
- Password
- FirstName
- LastName
- DepartmentName
- JobPositionName
- DateJoined
- TeamID

Notes:
- If DateJoined is set to a past date or the current date, the employee is considered as not being onboarded. If DateJoined is set to a future date, the employee is considered as currently being onboarded.
- The format for DateJoined is: YYYY-MM-DD.

Training table:
- ID (Number, auto increment)
- CourseName
- CategoryName
- Duration
- Description

Notes:
- The format for Duration is: m.
- m refers to minutes in this case.

## WidgetBot
It is a platform that might allow us to embed a Discord chatbot into the Kato web application, it allows the user to view and chat with a Discord chatbot in a server.

Pre-requisites (to be able to chat with the Discord chatbot):
- The user must authorize the application (using Discord OAuth) to grant it access to their Discord account.

When authorizing the application, a new browser window is opened where the authorization is performed, however, it seems that the browser gets stuck on a white screen after authorization has been granted (after authorization is granted, I am redirected to another page which is completely white and blank), the following error was also logged to the Developer Console at this time:
```
Uncaught TypeError: null has no properties

This happened when I was attempting to chat through the embedded widget on the landing page of WidgetBot's official website.
